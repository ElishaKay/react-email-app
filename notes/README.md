IMPORTANT:

Avi used Leonard with Jason on his computer.

I then used Leonard with Jason on my computer, and it generated a new User_id.

Meaning, every time you use the same User from Multiple computers, the results of several API Calls only include the data from the given computer the LI User was automated with.

Is there some way I can “join” the contents of two javascript arrays much like I would do a join in SQL?
